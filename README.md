# PhillyNetCC2016.1
Slides and demos for Phlly.NET CC 2016.1

This repository contains the slides and demos for "How I Learned to Love Dependency Injection" and "Isolate Your Tests with Mocks."

The content from the TDD pre-compiler is also included. Note for TDD precompiler attendees; The demo for Moq is in the "Isolate Your Tests with Mocks" materials and the Ninject demo is in the "How I Learned to Love Dependency Injection" folder. As these are the same demos for both sessions, I did this to save space and make the downlaod faster.

Thank you again for attneding my sessions and remember to follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jamesbender) for more content an find out where I'll be speaking next.

Thanks!
